# xc-hub-project
Python Based Cross Country Project including race data, plotting tools, and PR's for highschool team.

This is a work in progress Python passion project, I'm currently moving from pure python and pandas to using Anvil to make it a private website for me and my team to use. This is my first time writing any code and python so don't expect it to be good. Still figuring how to use github so this will probably change later, and I know no one is actually going to read this but I just want to keep tabs on my own work or show someone I actually made it if they care.
